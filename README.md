# Multi-Page Blog Data Scraping

## Project Description
This RPA workflow automates the extraction of structured data from a website that spans multiple pages. The process uses a data scraping wizard to navigate sequentially through a blog, extracting key information such as blog post titles, URLs, and other relevant details from each page.

## Project Objective
The primary objective is to eliminate the manual and repetitive task of copying and pasting data from a multi-page website. By automating this process, the project aims to:

- Save significant time and effort.

- Ensure a complete and accurate dataset.

- Compile extracted information into a clean, usable format (e.g., a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet).
